Patrick is an undergraduate in electrical engineering at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has experience in computer vision and machine
learning, and is interested in efficient implementations of these concepts.

Patrick does his work in GNU/Linux, and finds it much more user friendly than
Microsoft Windows. He switched from VSCode to Neovim, and maintains that it is
a performance boost, and not shooting himself in the foot.

Outside of engineering, Patrick enjoys piano, philosophy, sociology, running,
biking, Ultimate frisbee, and cooking.
